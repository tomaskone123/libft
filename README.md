# libft

This project is a personal implementation of essential C standard library functions. It includes the most common functions needed to manipulate memory, strings, and other fundamental tasks in C.

## Overview

The libft library contains various functions that you can use in your C projects to perform common tasks such as string manipulation, memory handling, and more. The goal of this project is to improve your understanding of C and build reusable utilities for future projects.

## Functions

The library includes the following types of functions:

- **Memory Management:** Functions for handling memory allocation and manipulation, such as `malloc`, `free`, and `memcpy`.
- **String Manipulation:** Functions for working with strings, such as `strlen`, `strcpy`, `strcmp`, and `strcat`.
- **Character Classification:** Functions for checking the types of characters, like `isdigit`, `isalpha`, `isalnum`, etc.
- **Utilities:** Miscellaneous functions, such as `itoa` (integer to string conversion) and `strdup` (duplicate a string).

## Usage

To use this library in your C projects, simply include the relevant header files and link the object files.

### Compilation

You can compile the library using the following commands:

```bash
make
